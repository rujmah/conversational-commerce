# Development Journey: Conversational Commerce AI Assistant

This document chronicles the development process, decisions, challenges, and evolution of our AI-powered order status assistant.

## Project Genesis

**Initial Request**: Review a PDF document about conversational commerce backend and create endpoints with a demo client using the Next.js boilerplate.

**Key Requirements from PDF**:
- AI agent for order status inquiries
- GraphQL integration for order data
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for external consumption
- Real-time streaming capabilities

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Agent Strategy Discussion
**Question**: Should we use multiple agents working simultaneously or a single agent approach?

**Decision**: Single agent implementation
- **Reasoning**: Simpler to manage, debug, and maintain
- **Outcome**: Proved to be the right choice - streamlined development process

### 2. Development Philosophy
**Approach**: TDD principles with speed prioritization
- **User Direction**: "Use TDD principles, but let's prioritise speed of implementation"
- **Implementation**: Started with core functionality first, then added comprehensive tests
- **Result**: Achieved both speed and quality with 8/8 tests passing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core AI Integration
**Initial Setup**:
- Started with AI SDK for OpenAI integration
- Implemented basic chat interface
- Added GraphQL integration for order lookup

**Challenge**: Empty message responses from OpenAI
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient system prompting and conversation flow
- **Solution**: Enhanced system prompt with explicit instructions: "ALWAYS provide a friendly, conversational response"
- **Additional Fix**: Added `maxSteps: 5` to ensure multi-step conversations

### Phase 2: Package Migration Issues
**Problem**: Deprecated package usage
- **Issue**: Using deprecated `ai/react` package
- **User Correction**: "we should be using @ai-sdk/react package as ai/react is deprecated"
- **Resolution**: Migrated to `@ai-sdk/react` with proper imports

**Status Management Bug**:
- **Issue**: Using deprecated `isLoading` property
- **User Correction**: "isLoading is deprecated. We need to use status"
- **Learning**: Status values are: "submitted", "streaming", "ready", "error"
- **Fix**: Updated to proper status checking: `status === "submitted" || status === "streaming"`

### Phase 3: SSE Endpoint Implementation
**Requirement Evolution**: Client wanted traditional SSE endpoint alongside React chat
- **User Request**: "the document specifies that the client wants an SSE endpoint"
- **Implementation**: Created `/api/sse` with traditional `data:` formatted events
- **Features Added**:
  - Proper SSE event types (connected, typing, chunk, completed, error, [DONE])
  - Full CORS support for external integration
  - Real-time streaming with OpenAI

### Phase 4: Architecture Refinement
**Landing Page Request**: 
- **User Direction**: "add a landing page that gives the option of the chat UI or the SSE demo UI"
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created comprehensive landing page with navigation cards
  - Moved chat interface to `/chat` route
  - Added SSE demo at `/sse-demo` with real-time event monitoring
  - Updated all metadata and navigation

### Phase 5: Security Implementation & Reversal

#### API Key Authentication Addition
**User Request**: "implement a API KEY for the SSE Endpoint"

**Implementation**:
- Added `x-api-key` header validation to SSE endpoint
- Environment variable `SSE_API_KEY` for configuration
- Optional authentication (no key required if env var not set)
- Updated demo interface with API key input field

**Security Discussion**:
- **User Question**: "is putting the api key in the client a security concern?"
- **My Response**: Identified serious security risks:
  - API keys visible in browser dev tools
  - Exposed in JavaScript bundle
  - Client-side keys easily extracted and misused
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive security warnings to demo interface

#### Basic Auth Implementation & Removal
**User Request**: "add a basic auth for the app"

**Implementation**:
- Created middleware for HTTP Basic Auth
- Environment variables for configuration
- Browser-native auth dialogs
- Protected all routes except API endpoints

**Direction Change**: "remove the auth"
- **Quick Reversal**: Removed all basic auth components
- **Reason**: User decided against application-wide authentication
- **Kept**: SSE API key functionality (more targeted security)

## Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Empty AI Responses
**Problem**: OpenAI returning empty messages after tool calls
**Root Cause**: Insufficient guidance for post-tool response generation
**Solution**: Enhanced system prompt with explicit response requirements

### 2. Package Deprecation
**Problem**: Using outdated AI SDK packages and APIs
**Learning**: Stay current with rapidly evolving AI SDK ecosystem
**Solution**: Migrated to latest packages with proper status management

### 3. Dual Endpoint Architecture
**Challenge**: Supporting both modern React hooks and traditional SSE
**Solution**: Created two complementary endpoints:
- `/api/chat/stream` - AI SDK optimized for React
- `/api/sse` - Traditional SSE with proper event formatting

### 4. Security Balance
**Challenge**: Providing security without compromising usability
**Solution**: Optional authentication with clear security guidance

## Final Architecture

### Application Structure
```
├── Landing Page (/) - Navigation hub
├── Chat Interface (/chat) - AI SDK streaming with React hooks
├── SSE Demo (/sse-demo) - Traditional SSE testing interface
├── API Endpoints
│   ├── /api/chat/stream - AI SDK streaming
│   └── /api/sse - Traditional SSE with optional API key auth
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 with function calling via AI SDK
- **Data**: GraphQL integration with Apollo Client
- **Streaming**: Dual approach (AI SDK + traditional SSE)
- **Authentication**: Optional API key for SSE endpoint
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (8/8 tests passing)

### Security Features
- Optional SSE API key authentication
- Clear security warnings in demo interface
- Environment-based configuration
- Production security recommendations

## Lessons Learned

### 1. User-Driven Development
- User corrections were crucial for staying current with AI SDK ecosystem
- Real-time feedback improved implementation quality
- Flexibility in requirements led to better final product

### 2. Security Considerations
- Client-side API key exposure is a serious concern
- Demo interfaces need clear security warnings
- Optional authentication provides deployment flexibility

### 3. Architecture Evolution
- Started simple, evolved to meet real-world needs

2. **Monitoring**: Add observability for AI interactions and SSE connections
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling for production deployment
4. **Caching**: Consider response caching for frequently asked order status queries
